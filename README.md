# JavaScript Null Value Handling Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript when handling null values. The `foo` function adds two numbers, but it doesn't properly handle cases where one or both inputs are `null`, leading to unexpected `null` outputs.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the function.
